                                                      Phonebook using doubly linnked list
                                                                     

This is a mini project written in c programming language.</br>
Data structure used is doubly linked list.</br>

This is a menu driven program which contains mainly 5 functions:</br>
1.Add new node</br>
2.Delete node</br>
3.Search for a node(by name)</br>
4.Display information in all nodes(ascending by name)</br>
5.Display total number of nodes</br>

Nodes are created using structure.</br>
Structure definition contains three data fields name,number and email and two address fields left and right.</br>
Each node stores information of a person in phonebook.</br>

This program inserts new node to linked list in ascending order so the time complexity is O(n*n) to insert n nodes.,/br>
The time complexity to delete a node, search for a node, display information of all nodes and display total number of nodes is O(n).</br>
