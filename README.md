                                                                 Phonebook using doubly linnked list
                                                                     

This is a mini project written in c programming language.
Data structure used is doubly linked list.

This is a menu driven program which contains mainly 5 functions:
1.Add new node
2.Delete node
3.Search for a node(by name)
4.Display information in all nodes(ascending by name)
5.Display total number of nodes

Nodes are created using structure.
Structure definition contains three data fields name,number and email and two address fields left and right.
Each node stores information of a person in phonebook.

This program inserts new node to linked list in ascending order so the time complexity is O(n*n) to insert n nodes.
The time complexity to delete a node, search for a node, display information of all nodes and display total number of nodes is O(n).
